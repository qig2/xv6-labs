1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
For function f() and g(), the a0 register contains argument to the function. The main() function also uses a1 and a2 registers.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?
main() calls function f in line 28 using the inline functions, which directly calculates f(8). For function f, it calls
function g at line 14: addiw	a0,a0,3.

3. At what address is the function printf located?
At address 0x630.

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x30

5. What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters. The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
    If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
Output is "HE110 World". If big-endian, we need to set i = 0x726c6400, 57616 doesn't have to change.

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
   	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
The output depends on the value in a2 register.
